# douban-crawler

This repository contain a very simple crawler for retrieving movies from the site douban. This is a simplified version of [this](https://github.com/jctian96/douban-web-crawler) webcrawler. Therefore all the credits goes to him.

The principle is to create a query on this webpage [https://movie.douban.com/j/new_search_subjects?](https://movie.douban.com/j/new_search_subjects?) with some search queries such as type, rate, etc.
The different query can be found using this url [https://movie.douban.com/tag/#/](https://movie.douban.com/tag/#/). By selecting a query it is possible to know how to change the URL to affine the research. To combine several tags, for example '中国大陆' and '电视剧', a comma need to be used '中国大陆,电视剧'
